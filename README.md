# EXOTIC (EXOplanet Transit Interpretation Code)

A Python 3 package for analyzing photometric data of transiting exoplanets into lightcurves and retrieving transit epochs and planetary radii.

The EXOplanet Transit Interpretation Code relies upon the [transit method](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/alien-worlds/ways-to-find-a-planet/#/2) for exoplanet detection. This method detects exoplanets by measuring the dimming of a star as an orbiting planet transits, which is when it passes between its host star and the Earth. If we record the host star’s emitted light, known as the flux, and observe how it changes as a function of time, we should observe a small dip in the brightness when a transit event occurs. A graph of host star flux vs. time is known as a lightcurve, and it holds the key to determining how large the planet is, and how long it will be until it transits again.

The objective of this pipeline is to help you reduce your images of your transiting exoplanet into a lightcurve, and fit a model to your data to extract planetary information that is crucial to increasing the efficiency of larger observational platforms, and futhering our astronomical knowledge.

## Installation and Running

EXOTIC can run on a Windows, Macintosh, or Linux/Unix computer. You can also use EXOTIC via the free Google Colab, which features cloud computing, many helpful plotting functions, and a simplified installation. However, if you are a user with many images or large images, we recommend running EXOTIC locally on your own computer.

 **Google Colab Cloud**
  - Features: does not require the user to install any software locally on their own computer.
  - Limitations: Requires user to upload their images to a free Gdrive account.
  - Recommendations: If you run out of space on your default Google/Gdrive account, you can sign up for a new, free account to use. Some users even make a new Google account for every new dataset to avoid running out of space.

  - [EXOTIC: Google Colab Cloud Version](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1UcDfm3z1WnfdOpRwjCQYwDgK9Wh2cU6x?usp=sharing) (includes step-by-step instructions)
  

 **Locally On Your Own Computer**
  - Features: Images are read off of the user's harddrive- nothing is uploaded to Gdrive. This method can be helpful for those with large filesizes, many files, or a slow internet connection.
  - Limitations: Requires user to install Python3 and multiple subpackages.
  
  - Installation Instructions:
    1. ​[Download and install the latest release of Python.](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
        **NOTE FOR WINDOWS USERS:** make sure to check the box "Add Python to PATH" when installing.
        **NOTE FOR ALL USERS:** please download and install the latest release of Python, even if you have a previous installation already on your computer, to ensure that all Python packages are properly installed.
    2. [Download the latest release of EXOTIC.](https://github.com/rzellem/EXOTIC/releases)
    3. Unzip this file.
    4. Double-click on the appropriate installer for your operating system:
        - Windows: run_exotic_windows.bat
        - Macintosh: run_exotic_macintosh.command
        - Linux: run_exotic_linux.sh
    5. If you get a security warning about the software being from an unidentified, unsigned, or non-trusted developer, you can bypass it by:
        - Windows: click "More info" and then the "Run away" box at the bottom of the window.
        - Macintosh: Please follow [these instructions](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/open-a-mac-app-from-an-unidentified-developer-mh40616/mac).

- **We also recommend that you download our [sample transiting exoplanet dataset](https://github.com/rzellem/EXOTIC_sampledata)** to confirm that EXOTIC is running correctly on the Google Colab Cloud or your own computer.

## Requirements
FITS files with a modern header including parameters for UT time, exposure time, WCS coordinations (optional) are required for EXOTIC.

## Sample Data and Outputs
We provide a [sample dataset](https://github.com/rzellem/EXOTIC_sampledata/releases/) consisting of 142 `fits` files taken by a 6” telescope of the exoplanet HAT-P-32 b (V-mag = 11.44) observed on December 20, 2017. The telescope used to collect this dataset is part of the [MicroObservatory Robotic Telescope Network](http://microobservatory.org) operated by the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.

[Sample Data](https://github.com/rzellem/EXOTIC_sampledata/releases/)

A lightcurve from the sample dataset is shown below:
