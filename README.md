A Python 3 package for reducing and analyzing photometric data of exoplanetary transits. As an exoplanet passes in front of its host star, the observed brightness of the star drops by a small amount. This drop in brightness is known as a [transit]((https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/alien-worlds/ways-to-find-a-planet/#/2)). Our software aids in creating lightcurves from images, enabling extraction of planetary parameters (e.g. Rp/Rs, Inclination, Mid-transit, etc.) through fitting astrophysical models to the data.

## Installation + Setup

To install EXOTIC, you need to have Python 3.10 or lower installed on your computer. You can then install EXOTIC by following these steps:

1. Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) (a minimal version of Anaconda) on your computer.
2. Create a new virtual environment and activate it:

   ```
   conda create -n exotic python=3.10
   conda activate exotic
   ```
3. Install EXOTIC and its dependencies:
   ```
   pip install exotic
   ```
5. (Optional) Run EXOTIC's graphical user interface (GUI):
   ```
   exotic-gui
   ```

After installing EXOTIC, you can verify the installation by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```
python -c "import exotic"
```

If EXOTIC is installed correctly, you should not see any error messages. You can now start using EXOTIC by following the [examples](https://github.com/rzellem/EXOTIC/tree/main/examples) provided in the repository or by using our [sample dataset](https://github.com/rzellem/EXOTIC_sampledata/releases/). **If you're a new user**, we recommend starting with the beginner tutorial in Google Colab and then following our installation instructions for your operating system.

## Google Colab Cloud

Google Colab is a free cloud service that allows you to run Python code in a Jupyter notebook environment without having to install any software on your computer. We have a series of tutorials that you can run in Google Colab to learn how to use EXOTIC. You can access these tutorials by clicking on the following links:
- [Beginner Tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Xxx7XAwgRhtV7VmxpE1Jsb3SUumsZjWR) for getting started with [sample data](https://github.com/rzellem/EXOTIC_sampledata/releases/)
- [Standard Tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1CNRbMQC0FmiVC9Pxj_lUhThgXqgbrVB_) for people who use data from MicroObservatory robotic telescopes (we can give you [data](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/exoplanet-watch/how-to-contribute/data-checkout/) to convert to a light curve)
- [Advanced Tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1_954Ec5bWeAH9r8xAxRZ1EmhF_03xVfe) for people who use observations from their own telescope

## Sample Data
We recommend you test exotic with a [sample dataset](https://github.com/rzellem/EXOTIC_sampledata/releases/) consisting of 142 `fits` files taken by a 6‚Äù telescope of the exoplanet HAT-P-32 b (V-mag = 11.44) observed on December 20, 2017. The telescope used to collect this dataset is part of the [MicroObservatory Robotic Telescope Network](http://microobservatory.org) operated by the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.

A lightcurve from the sample dataset is shown below:

![Lightcurve graph showing relative flux versus phase with error bars and interpolated curve.](https://github.com/rzellem/EXOTIC/raw/main/docs/images/HAT-P-32bExample.png)

Exotic will output the final parameters in a text file and a plot of the light curve. The output will look similar to the following:

```
