A Python 3 package for analyzing photometric data of transiting exoplanets into lightcurves and retrieving transit epochs and planetary radii.

The EXOplanet Transit Interpretation Code relies upon the [transit method](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/alien-worlds/ways-to-find-a-planet/#/2) for exoplanet detection. This method detects exoplanets by measuring the dimming of a star as an orbiting planet transits, which is when it passes between its host star and the Earth. If we record the host star’s emitted light, known as the flux, and observe how it changes as a function of time, we should observe a small dip in the brightness when a transit event occurs. A graph of host star flux vs. time is known as a lightcurve, and it holds the key to determining how large the planet is, and how long it will be until it transits again.

The objective of this pipeline is to help you reduce your images of your transiting exoplanet into a lightcurve, and fit a model to your data to extract planetary information that is crucial to increasing the efficiency of larger observational platforms, and futhering our astronomical knowledge.

## New Users
Below are the instructions for installing and running EXOTIC for the first time. However, if you are a new user, we recommend you follow the "How to Run EXOTIC Locally on your Computer using the Sample Data" tutorial, which includes detailed installation instructions, on our website under ["How to Analyze Your Exoplanet Observations"](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/exoplanet-watch/how-to-contribute/how-to-reduce-your-data/).

## Installation and Running

EXOTIC can run on a Windows, Macintosh, or Linux/Unix computer using Python 3.10. You can also use EXOTIC via the free Google Colab, which features cloud computing, many helpful plotting functions, and a simplified installation. However, if you are a user with many images or large images, we recommend running EXOTIC locally on your own computer.

`pip install exotic`

## How to Run EXOTIC

To run a full photometric reduction with light curve modeling, use the following command:

`exotic -red inits.json -ov`

```
usage: exotic [-h] [-rt [REALTIME]] [-red [REDUCE]] [-pre [PREREDUCED]] [-phot [PHOTOMETRY]] [-ov] [-nea]

Using a JSON initialization file to bypass user inputs for EXOTIC.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -rt [REALTIME], --realtime [REALTIME]
                        Plots transit in real-time while observing with a telescope. An initialization file (e.g., inits.json) is optional to use with this command.
  -red [REDUCE], --reduce [REDUCE]
                        Performs aperture photometry on FITS files and a reduction on dataset. An initialization file (e.g., inits.json) is optional to use with this command.
  -pre [PREREDUCED], --prereduced [PREREDUCED]
                        Performs a reduction on dataset using the nested sampler only. An initialization file (e.g., inits.json) is optional to use with this command.
  -phot [PHOTOMETRY], --photometry [PHOTOMETRY]
                        Performs only aperture photometry on FITS files. An initialization file (e.g., inits.json) is optional to use with this command.
  -ov, --override       Adopts all JSON planetary parameters, which will override the NASA Exoplanet Archive. Can be used as an additional argument with -rt (--realtime), -red (--reduce), -pre
                        (--prereduced), and -phot (--photometry).Do not combine with the -nea, --nasaexoarch argument.
  -nea, --nasaexoarch   Adopts all the NASA Exoplanet Archive planetary parameters from https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu. Can be used as an additional argument with -rt (--realtime), -red
                        (--reduce), -pre (--prereduced), and -phot (--photometry).Do not combine with the -ov, --override argument.
```

## Sample Data and Outputs
We provide a [sample dataset](https://github.com/rzellem/EXOTIC_sampledata/releases/) consisting of 142 `fits` files taken by a 6” telescope of the exoplanet HAT-P-32 b (V-mag = 11.44) observed on December 20, 2017. The telescope used to collect this dataset is part of the [MicroObservatory Robotic Telescope Network](http://microobservatory.org) operated by the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. **We also recommend that you download our [sample transiting exoplanet dataset](https://github.com/rzellem/EXOTIC_sampledata)** to confirm that EXOTIC is running correctly on the Google Colab Cloud or your own computer.

A lightcurve from the sample dataset is shown below:
