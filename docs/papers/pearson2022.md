The transiting planet HD~80606~b undergoes a 1000-fold increase in insolation during its 111 day orbit due to it being highly eccentric ($e$=0.93). The planet's effective temperature increases from 400~K to over 1400~K in a few hours as it makes a rapid passage to within 0.03~AU of its host star during periapsis. Spectroscopic observations during the eclipse (which is conveniently oriented a few hours before periapsis) of HD~80606~b with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) are poised to exploit this highly variable environment to study a wide variety of atmospheric properties, including composition, chemical and dynamical timescales, and large scale atmospheric motions. Critical to planning and interpreting these observations is an accurate knowledge of the planet's orbit. We report on observations of two full-transit events: 7 February 2020 as observed by the TESS spacecraft and  7--8 December 2021 as observed with a world-wide network of small telescopes. We also report new radial velocity observations which when analyzed with a coupled model to the transits greatly improves the planet's orbital ephemeris. Our new orbit solution reduces the uncertainty in the transit and eclipse timing of the JWST era from tens of minutes to a few minutes. When combined with the planned JWST observations, this new precision may be adequate to look for non-Keplerian effects in the orbit of HD~80606~b.


## 2021 Transit from the Ground

HD~80606~b's long transit duration, over 11.5~hr \citep{Pont2009,Winn2009},  and the accumulated uncertainty in its time of occurrence, make a world-wide program of coordinated observations essential. Fortunately, networks of small and modest sized telescopes (e.g., Exoplanet Watch\footnote{https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/exoplanet-watch/}, ExoClock\footnote{http://exoclock.space}, Unistellar\footnote{https://unistellaroptics.com/}) are now in place to support programs of this type. The global observational campaign to measure the 2021 December 7--8 transit of HD~80606~b presented here was  coordinated by Exoplanet Watch. The various observatories that contributed a transit measurement in December are shown in Figure \ref{fig:Map}.

\section{Observations \label{sec:obs}}

A majority of the transit observations for HD 80606 b originate almost a decade ago when it was a targeted by the Spitzer Space Telescope. Since then, there hasn't been a full transit observation in $\sim$10 years although the star has been monitored by radial velocity surveys. In preparation for JWST observations we have combined observations of the 2020 transit taken by TESS with 2021 observations taken from the ground by the Exoplanet Watch program. Finally, the light curve measurements are combined with new and archival radial velocity measurements in order to constrain the orbit parameters and to improve our knowledge of transit and eclipse events over the next decade. 


\subsection{2020 Transit With TESS}
The photometric data from TESS were processed using a custom pipeline leveraging optimal aperture selection, systematic detrending with a weighted spline and outlier rejection in order to improve and minimize the scatter in the light curve \citep{Pearson2019b}. The custom pipeline uses multiple aperture sizes during the photometric extraction in order to minimize the scatter in the residuals after fitting a light curve model. Detrending the time series and minimizing scatter in the residuals has been shown to improve light curve quality compared to the default produced from the Science Processing Operations Center (SPOC) pipeline \citep{Jenkins2016} which is based on the Kepler mission pipeline \citep{Jenkins2010}.

TESS is capable of high precision measurements for this system due to the host star being bright (V=9.0 mag). However, TESS's large pixel size (21\arcsec) is less than ideal for HD~80606 due to the presence of HD~80607, a nearby  companion of similar spectral type and brightness (V=9.07 mag) separated by 20.5\arcsec. Stellar blends  dilute the transit signal causing a larger planet to mistakenly appear smaller \citep[e.g.,][]{Ciardi15, Zellem2020}. In the reduction of TESS data, a wide aperture was used and includes light from both stars. Therefore, our estimate for the transit depth is underestimated. The estimated contamination is around $\sim$48$\%$ and translates to a corrected transit depth $\sim2\times$ greater than what we directly measure. Despite the contamination decreasing the transit depth, we still detect the transit at over 40 $\sigma$ which allows for a strong constraint on the time of mid-transit to within a few minutes (see Table~\ref{tab:newmid} and Figure \ref{fig:joint_transit}).

\subsubsection{Exoplanet Watch}
Exoplanet Watch is a citizen science project funded by NASA's Universe of Learning\footnote{https://www.universe-of-learning.org} for observing exoplanets with small, ground-based telescopes to maintain ephemerides and to ensure the efficient use of large telescopes, discover new exoplanets via transit timing variations, resolve blended pairs, monitor for stellar variability, and confirm exoplanet candidates \citep{Zellem2019, Zellem2020}. Anyone is able to contribute observations to a public data archive\footnote{https://app.aavso.org/exosite/}, hosted by the American Association of Variable Star Observers\footnote{http://aavso.org}, where they are analyzed on a regular basis and used to refine exoplanet ephemerides\footnote{https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/exoplanet-watch/results/}. The observations listed under Exoplanet Watch in Table~\ref{tab:facilities} are currently available online and are linked to their AAVSO observer code. A majority of the users contributed at least one hour of observations using telescopes smaller than 0.5-meters. A few notable contributors to the network include the Boyce-Astro Research Observatory (BARO) located at an observing site near Tierra Del Sol and Campo, California. BARO includes a 17-inch telescope and a ZWO ASI 1600 CMOS camera. The observing configuration provides a 8.3'$\times$6.3' field of view with a plate scale of 0.107'' per pixel. Additionally, an individual user was able to capture part of transit egress from the top of the Cahill building on the campus of California Institute of Technology using a 6~inch telescope and the ASI 224MC camera. 

Another contributor is the  MicroObservatory which hosts a network of automated remote reflecting telescopes, each with a 6-inch mirror, 560-mm focal length, and KAF1402ME CCD with 6.8-micron-sized pixels. With 2×2 pixel binning, the image size is 650×500 pixels  at a pixel scale of approximate 5”/px. MicroObservatory takes images of exoplanet systems daily and makes the images publicly available for educational use via their DIY Planet Search program\footnote{https://mo-www.cfa.harvard.edu/MicroObservatory/}.


\subsubsection{LCO Network}
Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO) is a global telescope network consisting of multiple meter and sub-meter sized telescopes at various locations around the Earth. HD~80606 was observed over the course of 3 days from multiple locations in the LCO network. Unfortunately,   weather  clouded-out most of the Northern Hemisphere so that only a few sites acquired data. A majority of the usable observations come from LCO's telescopes at McDonald Observatory in Texas and Teide Observatory in Tenerife. LCO's 0.4-meter telescopes contain SBIG CCD cameras with a field of view  $\sim$29' $\times$ 29', corresponding to a plate scale of 0.571''/pixel. The 1-meter telescope apart of LCO contains a Sinistro imager with a 26' $\times$ 26' field of view and a plate scale of 0.39''/px. All of the LCO observations were acquired with the R filter and some observatory-specific details are highlighted in Table~\ref{tab:facilities}.

\subsubsection{Unistellar Network}

The Unistellar Network is a global community of citizen scientist observers with Unistellar telescopes who have open access to observing campaigns organized by SETI Institute astronomers, including exoplanet transit observations. Seven different eVscopes (``Enhanced Vision Telescopes'') acquired nine observations of HD~80606~b from six different observing locations in North America, Europe, and Japan (Table~\ref{tab:facilities}). Of those observations, seven were collected using the Unistellar eVscope~1, which is a 4.5-inch reflecting telescope with a Sony IMX224LQR CMOS sensor at its prime focus. The camera's field of view is 37.0$\arcmin$ x 27.7$\arcmin$ with a plate scale of 1.7 $\arcsec$/pixel. Individual images had an exposure time of 3.970~s and sensor gain of 2 dB. The two remaining observations were collected using the Unistellar eVscope~2, which shares the design of the eVscope~1 but has a Sony IMX347LQR CMOS sensor. The camera's field of view is 45.3$\arcmin$ x 34.0$\arcmin$ with a plate scale of 1.3 $\arcsec$/pixel. Individual images had an exposure time of 3.970~s and sensor gain of 0~dB (no digital gain).

\subsubsection{ExoClock Project}

In addition to the TESS and December transit of HD 80606 b we also report on three additional transit measurements from the project ExoClock \citep{Kokori2021}. The ExoClock project is an open-access citizen science project aimed at conducting transit measurements of exoplanets targeted by the Ariel Mission \citep{Tinetti16}. The three measurements were taken from ground-based observatories in Europe with mid-transit measurements reported in Table~\ref{tab:oldmid}.

\subsubsection{GROWTH}

The Global Relay of Observatories Watching Transients Happen (GROWTH) network involves over a dozen institutions dedicated to the follow-up of transient events \citep{Kasliwal2019}. Among these, a number of Asian observatories within the GROWTH collaboration participated in the 2021 Dec 7/8 campaign, providing critical data during transit ingress. The GROWTH-India Telescope (GIT) is a 0.7m fully robotic telescope located at the Indian Astronomical Observatory (IAO), Hanle-Ladakh. The telescope is equipped with an Andor Ikon230XL CCD camera which provides a Field of view of $\sim0.5~\rm{deg}^2$. GIT observed HD~80606~b for $\sim 5$~hrs on night of Dec~7, 2022, obtaining a total of 609 images. The details of the observations are provided in  Table~\ref{tab:facilities}. Data were reduced following standard procedures, and photometry was performed with EXOTIC as described in 3.2.

\subsection{Transit Data Reduction}

Data reduction and calibrations of the individual science images was done by each observer or their group. We encouraged all groups to acquire at least a bias and flat-field frame in order to reduce noise and normalize pixel to pixel changes in sensitivity, respectively. We provided an open-source package for aperture photometry and light curve fitting in order to make extracting the time series easy and optimal with respect to minimizing sources of noise. The EXOplanet Transit Interpretation Code\footnote{https://github.com/rzellem/EXOTIC} (EXOTIC; \citealt{Zellem2020}; Fatahi et al. \textit{in prep.}) can calibrate images (i.e. bias, flat and dark), plate solve images for better centroiding and conducts an optimization over comparison star selection and aperture when extracting the photometric timeseries. After conducting aperture photometry, all of the time series files were combined in order to produce the global light curve shown in Figure \ref{fig:BestFit}. A mosaic of the individual observations is shown in the appendix (see Figure \ref{fig:mosaic}.)


\subsection{Radial Velocity Observations\label{sec:PRV}}

New radial velocity observations were obtained around periapsis in December 2021 using the Levy spectrometer on the 2.4m Automated Planet Finder telescope (APF) \citep{Vogt2014} and the High Resolution spectrometer (HIRES, on the 10m Keck I telescope). The new RV measurements are processed using standard data reduction techniques described in \citet{Butler1996}. The APF and HIRISE RV values are measured using an Iodine cell-based design in order wavelength calibrate the stellar spectrum. The spectral region from 5000-6200 $\AA$ is used for measuring the radial velocities. The new observations are listed in Table~\ref{tab:NEW_RV}. We used a total of 286 RV measurements spanning 22 years for the data analysis (see Figure \ref{fig:joint_rv}) and they are available in a machine readable format online (see Table \ref{tab:OLD_RV}). A portion of the historical data come from \cite{Naef2001} \cite{Wittenmyer2007} and \cite{Wittenmyer2009}.

\section{Analysis\label{sec:analysis}}

The newly acquired data of HD~80606 b along with the historical measurements for  RV, transit and eclipse are analyzed in a self-consistent manner in order to place constraints on the system parameters. The radial velocity observations help constrain the orbit and alignment of HD~80606~b, which is particularly important considering the high eccentricity of the planet can drastically change the transit duration based on the argument of periastron \citep{Hebrard2010}. The transit observations help  the size of the planet once the orbit is reliably known and disentangled from degeneracies involving the stellar radius,  inclination and contamination by HD 80607. Additionally, using the measured times of mid-transit and mid-eclipse we can search for deviations from a Keplerian orbit, which is potentially indicative of a companion in the system (\citealt{Holman2005}; \citealt{Nesvorney2008}).

\subsection{Global Light Curve Analysis}

Observations for the transit of HD~80606~b on the night of 2021 December 7--8 are combined and fitted simultaneously in order to derive the time of mid-transit and radius ratio between the planet and star. Since each observation was acquired at a different location, it requires individual treatment of extinction from Earth's atmosphere. We adopt a parameterization \citep[e.g.,][]{Pearson2019a} which scales exponentially with airmass and has resemblance to a solution of the radiative transfer equation when the source function is $I(\tau) = I(0)e^{-\tau}$. The following equation is used to maximize the likelihood of the transit model and airmass signal simultaneously:

\begin{equation} \label{expam}
F_{obs} = a_{0} e^{a_{1} \beta }  F_{transit}.
\end{equation}

\noindent Here $F_{obs}$ is the flux recorded on the detector, $F_{transit}$ is the actual astrophysical signal (i.e., the transit light curve, given by pyLightcurve \citep{Tsiaras2016}, $a_{i}$ are airmass correction coefficients and $\beta$ is the airmass value. Since the underlying astrophysical signal is shared between all the observations we leave $R_{p}/R_{s}$ and $T_{mid}$ as free parameters during the retrieval and share the values between each dataset.

The free parameters are optimized using the multimodal nested sampling algorithm called UltraNest (\citealt{Feroz2008}; \citealt{Buchner2014}; \citealt{Buchner2017}). Ultranest is a Bayesian inference tool that uses the Monte Carlo strategy of nested sampling to calculate the Bayesian evidence allowing simultaneous parameter estimation and model selection. A nested sampling algorithm is efficient at probing parameter spaces which could potentially contain multiple modes and pronounced degeneracies in high dimensions; a regime in which the convergence for traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC; e.g., \citealt{ford05}) techniques becomes comparatively slow (\citealt{Skilling2004}; \citealt{Feroz2008}). Convergence for such a large retrieval can take a long time if the priors are very large and sometimes the solutions will not converge at all within a given range for likelihood evaluations for such a large dataset. Therefore, to aid with convergence, each observation was fit individually before being fit simultaneously and given priors to reflect $\pm5\sigma$ around the individual fits. The nested sampling algorithm runs for 500,000 likelihood evaluations before terminating with the resulting posterior distribution shown in Figure \ref{fig:posterior}. An open source version of the global retrieval is available through the EXOTIC repository on GitHub \footnote{https://github.com/rzellem/EXOTIC}. A non-linear 4 parameter limb darkening model is used for the both the ground-based measurements and TESS but corresponding to their respective filters \citep{Morello2020}.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Radial Velocity Analysis}
The archival and new RV measurements (Table~\ref{tab:NEW_RV} and Table~\ref{tab:OLD_RV}) are analyzed using a joint simultaneous fit between a TESS light curve and historical measurements for mid-transit and mid-eclipse in order to constrain a consistent orbital solution across 10 years of heterogeneous data. The radial velocity model uses the same orbit equation and Keplerian solver as the transit light curve model (PyLightcurve; \citealt{Tsiaras2016}). The orbit equation used in the transit model is 

\begin{equation}
    r_t = \frac{a}{R_s}\frac{(1-e^2)}{(1+e*cos(\nu_t))}
\end{equation} where $a$ is the semi-major axis, R$_s$ is the stellar radius, $e$ is the eccentricity, and $\nu$ is the true anomaly at some time $t$. The true anomaly can be solved for using equations 1 and 2 in \citealt{Fulton2018} by finding the root of an equation to get the eccentric anomaly which is then used to compute the true anomaly. The orbit equation is projected onto a Cartesian grid which is necessary for the transit model and useful for taking the dot product along our line of sight ensuring it matches the transit geometry (see Figure~\ref{fig:orbit}). The projection along the x-axis, or our line of sight is

\begin{equation}
x_t = r_t sin(\nu_t + \omega) sin(i)
\end{equation}

where $i$ is the inclination of the orbit and $\omega$ is the argument of periastron. The star's velocity is estimated after applying a scaling relation to the planet's orbit assuming it is in a two body system. Coupling the orbit solutions ensures a self consistent system where gravity balances the centripetal acceleration of the planet. The velocity vector of the planet is scaled to match that for the star's orbit and then projected along a line of sight in order to produce the RV signal. A velocity is estimated by evaluating the orbit equation twice in order to compute a numerical derivative using a time step of $\sim$8.5 seconds (0.0001 day):

\begin{equation}
    v_{r,t} = \frac{M_p}{M_s} R_s \frac{x_{t+\Delta t}-x_t}{\Delta t}
\end{equation}

In addition to scaling the planet's orbit by a mass ratio to mimic the stellar position it must also be scaled by the stellar radius in order to acquire units of meters. The stellar radius is given a Gaussian prior during the retrieval process in order to reflect uncertainties on that scale factor and because it is correlated with the planet's inclination. For instance, for a given transit duration there could be a small star with a non-inclined planet or a big star with an inclined planet. Either way they can produce the same transit duration and it is difficult to disentangle the two parameters without an additional constraint on the likelihood function (e.g. some spectral modelling is needed to constrain the stellar properties). We do not have enough information to uniquely constrain the stellar radius and inclination simultaneously which leads to a degeneracy in our retrieval if each parameter uses a uniform prior. Therefore, the stellar radius is given a Gaussian prior which is constructed to be consistent with past derivations in the literature (\citealt{Bonomo2017}; \citealt{Rosenthal2021}). 


## Joint simultaneous fit
Fitting three different types of measurements in a joint analysis requires a likelihood function with contributions from each data set. The system parameters are used to generate a coupled physical model for the transit, RV and ephemeris data in order to enforce consistency between the data sets. The likelihood function includes the sum of the chi-square values when comparing the data sets to their respective model. The TESS light curve is compared to a transit model in a manner similar to the global fit for all the ground-based measurements except the airmass correction is left out. The historic mid-transit and mid-eclipse measurements are compared to a linear ephemeris and then folded into the total chi-squared estimate. The radial velocity measurements are also folded into the total chi-squared however the uncertainties are adjusted prior to the joint fit. The radial velocity likelihood ($\mathcal{L}$) adopts a parameterization similar to RADVEL \citep{Fulton2018} in order to account for underestimated uncertainties,
\begin{equation} \label{rv_likelihood}
   \mathcal{L}_{RV} = -\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i} \sum_{t} (\frac{d_t - v_{r,t}}{\sigma_{i,t} + \sigma_i})^2
\end{equation}
\noindent where d$_t$ is the velocity measurement at time, $t$, $v_{r,t}$ is the Keplerian model predicted for each RV measurement, $\sigma_{i,t}$ is the original uncertainty on the radial velocity measurement and $\sigma_i$ is an RV jitter term for each data set, $i$. The jitter term is set after an individual fit to the radial velocity data and before the joint fit. The jitter term scales the uncertainty such that the average uncertainty is roughly equal to the standard deviation of the residuals from the individual fit. Additionally, the solution to the individual fit $\pm$ 5 sigma is used to constrain the priors for the joint fit. Our uncertainty scaling is similar to RADVEL however we do not include a penalty term which is required when fitting for an error scaling term. We adopt an easier correction for underestimated uncertainties while still being able to leverage the optimizations behind nested sampling. The errors are scaled after an individual fit to the RV data such that the average uncertainty is roughly equal to the scatter in the residuals for that particular data set. After inflating each uncertainty, we found our error estimate for orbital period increased by a factor of $\sim$2 and other orbit parameters similarly. 

The likelihood function for mid-transit and mid-eclipse represent the error for a linear ephemeris estimate compared to existing measurements  Whereas the transit likelihood function uses the photometric time-series.  Nested sampling is used to efficiently explore a large parameter space defining the system and to build a posterior distribution with which to infer uncertainties \citep{Buchner2021}. The free parameters include orbital period, time of mid-transit, inclination, argument of periastron, eccentricity, a planet mass and the radius ratio between the planet and star. Posteriors for the free parameters in the joint fit are shown in Figure 9. We also include a Gaussian prior on the stellar radius because it is needed to convert our radial velocity model into meters. The stellar radius is degenerate with inclination and difficult to constrain if left as a uniform prior. Another relationship in the posteriors is the perfect correlation between eccentricity and argument of periastron. We have seen similar correlations when fitting for $a_{0}$ and $\gamma$ that allowed us to simplify the retrieval and solve for them instead. It is theoretically possible to remove one of these parameters ($e$ or $\omega$) from the sampling process and solve for the other at run-time without having to build it into the posteriors. That solution however requires solving a transcendental equation on top of the existing orbit solution and would increase the computation time of the likelihood function. Therefore, we include both $e$ and $\omega$ in the retrieval and let the sampler handle the correlation which decreases its efficiency slightly.
